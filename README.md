# Browser Extension: Dynamic Text Interaction with Custom Prompts

Tired of switching tabs and copying/pasting text every time you need a translation, summary, or context? So was I! Instead of dealing with that hassle, I built this extension to streamline the process.

### Features

- **Custom Prompts**: Define your own tasks like translation, summarization, and more.
- **Quick Interaction**: Highlight text, choose a prompt, and see the results instantlyâ€”no tab-hopping required.
- **Built for Personal Use**: Made to solve my own browser frustrations, but it might just work for you too!

## A Little Backstory

After getting tired of constantly copying, switching tabs, and pasting text for translations or context, I decided to create a tool that lets me handle it all with a simple highlight and click.
